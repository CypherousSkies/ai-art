This is a long-term project for me, but one I've been meaning to start since I saw DALL-E and ArtBreeder. Theoretically, with pre-trained models it shouldn't be too hard, but one should never underestimate how difficult a simple pipeline might become. I'd love to incorporate elements of Disco Diffusion Turbo, but that's a stretch goal.

## Checkpoints
- [ ] VQGAN/Diffusion + CLIP (possibly allow for options?)
  - [ ]  Try using [this](https://github.com/nerdyrodent/CLIP-Guided-Diffusion)
- [ ] GANBreeder with PCA to improve control over results
- [ ] Upscaler
- [ ] User-interface server to run the whole thing
- [ ] Trained-from-scratch models for both at non-square resolutions (for portraits, desktop backgrounds, etc.)
